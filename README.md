# Project Summary
I have chosen to implement Bidirectional A* Pathfinding using Unity Jobs. This will result in very fast path calculations, even for many agents. Path Smoothing and Graph Scanning are also implemented with Unity Jobs, allowing optional path smoothing as well as re-scanning the graph.

# Classes
Seeker: Game objects that are seeking a path through the game world.

PathfindingJob: A Unity Job that runs the bidirectional A* algorithm to find a path from a start point to an end point in the game world.

PathSmoothingJob: An optional Unity Job that takes a path generated by the PathfindingJob and smooths it out to create more natural movement.

GraphScanningJob: A Unity Job that scans the scene to generate a graph for pathfinding, taking into account any obstacles in the scene.

JobScheduler: Schedules and manages all the Jobs (PathfindingJob, PathSmoothingJob, GraphScanningJob) ensuring they run on separate threads and not on the main thread.

PathfindingService: An interface that provides methods for Seekers to request paths, using the JobScheduler to run Jobs and returning the resulting paths.

Graph: Represents your game world as a 2D grid on the XZ plane and is used by the PathfindingJob to find paths.

GraphNode: This class represents a node in the graph. It should contain information about its position in the world, its connections to neighboring nodes, and its cost (which could be higher for nodes that contain obstacles).

Path: This class represents a path through the graph. It could be a simple list of GraphNodes, or it could contain additional information like the total cost of the path.

PathRequest: This class represents a pathfinding request. It contains the start and end points of the requested path and could also include additional parameters like a callback to be executed when the path is found.

PathResult: This class represents the result of a pathfinding request. It contains the resulting Path and any other relevant information like whether the pathfinding was successful.

JobHandleWrapper: This class wraps Unityâ€™s JobHandle structure and ensures that jobs are properly completed before they are disposed of.
